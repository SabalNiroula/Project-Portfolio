In this Social Media Analysis project, 245,000 tweets were scraped and preprocessed to gather insights on  tweets during the COVID-19 from January 2020 to June 2022. Data was collected using snscrape and preprocessed to clean and prepare it for analysis. The preprocessing steps included removing unwanted characters and links, converting data into the appropriate format, and handling missing values.

Once the data was prepared, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize and understand patterns and relationships in the data. The EDA aimed to answer questions about the sentiments of the tweets, relationship between each data and the countries with the highest engagement on social media.

The project provides an overview of the data and the findings obtained from the analysis. The visualizations and insights generated from this project can be used to understand how social media is being used and what people reacted to COVID-19. Overall, this Social Media Analysis project showcases the power of data analysis in understanding complex social media trends on COVID-19 Data.
