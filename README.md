Welcome to my GitHub repository where you will find a collection of my personal projects and assignments that I have completed during my education and professional experience in the field of machine learning, deep learning, data science and data analysis. This repository is a showcase of my technical abilities and my experience working with various technologies and tools, such as Python, tensorflow, and various machine learning libraries and frameworks.

You will find a variety of projects here, including data analysis and visualization of real-world datasets, natural language processing and computer vision projects, as well as machine learning and deep learning projects that demonstrate my ability to work with various techniques and models. Each project contains a detailed README file that provides a brief overview of the project, its features, the problem that it solves, and the technologies and methodologies used, as well as instructions for running the code.

This repository is updated regularly as I continue to work on new projects and improve existing ones. I hope that my projects will provide a glimpse into my technical abilities and potential as a data scientist and machine learning engineer. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me, I would be happy to discuss. Thank you for visiting!
