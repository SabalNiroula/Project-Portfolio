- Built a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model for classifying plant and fruit diseases
- Model is trained to identify multiple types of diseases including those affecting potato, tomato, grape, strawberry and pepper bell plants.
- Accurate in identifying and classifying various types of plant diseases. `Accuracy percentage : 95.7 %`
- Can be useful for farmers, agricultural researchers and other stakeholders in the agriculture industry
- Model can be further improved and fine-tuned for better accuracy and more disease classification
- Can be integrated with other systems like mobile app or web-app to make the classification process more user-friendly
- Can be useful in early disease detection and effective disease management
- The dataset used is publicly available and can be used to reproduce the results
- The model is trained and tested on multiple architectures and the best one is deployed
